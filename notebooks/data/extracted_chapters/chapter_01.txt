Medical pharmacology is a unique blend of basic pharmacology, clinical pharmacology and pharmacotherapeutics. The subject is highly dynamic with concepts and priority drugs changing rapidly. Innovations and developments are happening at an unprecedented pace. Several new molecular targets for drug action have been identified and novel drugs produced to attack them. On the other hand, a huge body of evidence has been generated to quantify impact of various drugs and regimens on well defined therapeutic end points, so that practice of medicine is transforming from ‘impression based’ to ‘evidence based’. The present edition focuses on evidence based medicine by referring to numerous large randomized trials and other studies which have shaped current therapeutic practices. By evaluating such evidences, professional bodies, eminent health institutes, expert committees and WHO have formulated therapeutic guidelines for treating many conditions, as well as for use of specific drugs. The latest guidelines have been summarized and included in the present edition along with other developments and the core content.
Adopting the ‘prototype drug’ approach and a structured, systematic and user-friendly format, all chapters have been thoroughly revised and updated. In this edition, drug classifications have been presented as eye-catching charts which help create pictorial memory. A new chapter on ‘Nitric Oxide and Vasoactive Peptide Signal Molecules’ has been added along with some recently introduced drugs which act through receptors for these molecules or by altering their turnover.
Priority has been accorded to drugs that are marketed in India, and their leading brand names are mentioned along with dosage forms. All recently released drugs are included, while those not commercially available or infrequently used have been excluded or described in small type.
India specific information on drugs and diseases finds a place in relevant topics. Treatment of diseases like TB, leprosy, HIV-AIDS, malaria, Kala-azar which are covered under WHO and National Health Programmes are described as per the latest recommendations of these organizations. Several new figures, charts, tables and highlight boxes have been added and many older ones have been revised/improved. The recent material and data has been authenticated by quoting its source. A brief list of useful references for further reading is provided at the end of the book. The ‘Problem directed study’ at the end of most chapters provides an exercise in therapeutic decision making.
I thank my colleagues and students for providing valuable inputs and raising thoughtful queries. As ever, the driving force behind this book has been Shri Jitendar P Vij (Group Chairman) and Mr Ankit Vij (Managing Director) of M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, New Delhi, India. The staff of Jaypee Brothers, especially Ms Sunita Katla (Executive Assistant to Group Chairman and Publishing Manager), Ms Geeta Srivastava (Proof Reader), Mr Manoj Pahuja (Graphic Designer) and Mr Kapil Dev Sharma (DTP Operator) deserve special commendation for excellent production of this text. Cooperation and participation of my wife has been pivotal.

Pharmacology is both a basic and an applied science. It forms the backbone of rational therapeutics. Whereas the medical student and the prescribing physician are primarily concerned with the applied aspects, correct and skilful application of drugs is impossible without a proper understanding of their basic pharmacology. Medical pharmacology, therefore, must include both fundamental background and clinical pharmacological information. Objective and quantitative data on the use of drugs in man, i.e., relationship between plasma concentration and intensity of therapeutic/toxic actions, plasma half lives, relative efficacy of different medications and incidence of adverse effects etc., are being obtained with the aim of optimising drug therapy. The concepts regarding mechanism of action of drugs are changing. In addition, new drugs are being introduced in different countries at an explosive pace. A plethora of information thus appears to be important. However, trying to impart all this to a medical student would be counter-productive.
One of the important aims of this book is to delineate the essential information about drugs. The opening sentence in each chapter defines the class of drugs considered. A ‘prototype’ approach has been followed by describing the representative drug of a class followed by features by which individual members differ from it. Leading trade names have been included. Clinically relevant drug interactions have been mentioned. Clear-cut guidelines on selection of drugs and their clinical status have been outlined on the basis of current information. Original, simple and self-explanatory illustrations, tables and flowcharts have been used with impunity. Selected chemical structures are depicted. Recent developments have been incorporated. However, discretion has been used in including only few of the multitude of new drugs not yet available in India. This is based on their likelihood of being marketed soon. The information and views have been arranged in an orderly sequence of distinct statements.
I hope this manageable volume book would serve to dispel awe towards pharmacology from the minds of medical students and provide a concise and uptodate information source for prescribers who wish to remain informed of the current concepts and developments concerning drugs.
My sincere thanks are due to my colleagues for their valuable comments and suggestions.
